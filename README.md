# Final Project: Race and Infant Mortality
The representation of population health statistics is a vital tool in understanding problems within health systems. One such problem is the stark disparity in maternal healthcare between white women and women of color, especially in the United States. Many sources report that Black mothers are up to 3 to 4 times more likely to die in childbirth than white counterparts, demonstrating an inequitable balance of care over population based on race.
