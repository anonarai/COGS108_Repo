    "Throughout history, the disparities between white people and people of color has always been stark, especially in the realm of health and healthcare in the United States. These inequities have been observed and reported upon recently in the effect of race and ethnicity on infant mortality. For example, NPR reported that black mothers are 3 times more likely to die in childbirth than their white counterparts, showing that infants born into minority groups have an initial and perpetual disadvantage in care. Our group wanted to analyze whether or not this gap in care was reflected in infant mortality and showed higher rates of death among infants based on race and ethnicity. The hypothesis stemmed from the logic that if maternal death rates are higher among women of color, then infant mortality rates must follow the same trend. While this is a bleak subject, it is important in strengthening the dire situation our Black mothers and children are facing. \n",

    "This project explores the relationship between race and healthcare provision as represented by infant mortality. Should we find that racial identity does negatively impact the survival of infants in childbirth, this could implicate the larger health disadvantage into adulthood for people of color. Future research may include tracking the health and morbidity of all ages by race and ethnicity. Larger implications of our results would also hold social, political, and health structure liable to negligence and reinforce that these problems be addressed for the justice and betterment of population health. On a smaller scale, certain counties that have been identified as having larger minority populations and treating them with inferior care must re-evaluate and modify their practices to equalize care across all identities. From a public health perspective, most likely some intervention such as additional training for healthcare personnel could be implemented based on our results. \n"
